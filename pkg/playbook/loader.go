/*
Each run-relevant inventory entry has its own "view" on the given playbook containting
only the relevant plays for its groups.

Given a list of groups, the playbook loader

* loads the playbook (without evaluation)
* filters the plays based on the given groups
* loads the values relevant for the given groups (without evaluation)
* merges the filtered playbook and values
* evaluates the result
* unmarshalls the merged/evaluated playbook/value map into a valid playbook config structure
